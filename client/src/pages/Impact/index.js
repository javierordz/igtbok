                <p>Itâ€™s Going To Be Ok Inc. (IGTBOK) is a 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) non-profit charity started in 2014 by Tonya Stafford, a survivor herself of human trafficking, in Dallas, Texas. 
                    The IGTBOK mission is to create a just world where women, children, and all vulnerable adults are safe, respected, and valued. The vision is to eradicate human trafficking, one survivor at a time, regardless of ethnicity or background.
                    With these principles, IGTBOK has grown in recognition throughout the state of Texas and continues reaching lives across the entire United States.</p>
